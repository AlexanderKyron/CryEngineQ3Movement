# Quake 3 Movement in CryEngine
This is a modifified version of the CryEngine C++ first person shooter sample, with all the mechanics stripped out leaving a player with Quake 3 style movement, ported nearly 1:1. 

CryEngine's physics do change the feeling but it is very functional, and the bunny hopping feels great.
